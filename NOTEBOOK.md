In order for this to work we need:

- some measurement(s) of asteroseismic properties (nu_max, delta_nu), preferably from multiple pipelines
- the stars to be in Tycho-2 so that we will get them in Gaia DR1
- reliable temperatures (for the asteroseismic logg determination) and metallicities (to look at the error in asteroseismic logg as a function of Teff)

Hekker et al catalog
+ Tycho-2 cross-match
+ APOKASC

leads to 262 giants

Hekker et al catalog
+ Tycho-2 cross-match
+ The Cannon (CSE) catalog

leads to 489 matches, of which 481 are 'OK' because ASPCAP also says they are a giant (i.e., no Teff cut made yet)
